## Overview
Frontend Mentor has a lot of fun and rewarding challenges for any developer to practice their skills with! 
I decided for my very first challenge to take on the very simple QR Code for Frontend Mentor. Created only with HTML5 and CSS3.

## My process
Being a beginner in web development, creating things from scratch is still a challenge in itself for me. I decided to try and tackle this project starting with the position property.
<br>
That didn't work. So next I tried CSS Grid, and that worked soooo much easier! 
Edite* I am still trying to learn the ropes of mobile first! I apologize! I will update the solution once I learn more.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow (attempted)

### What I learned

I learned how to use the CSS Grid, as well as how not to use the positon property as it is not really mobile friendly.

CSS I am proud of (I really enjoy variables!)
```
:root {
    --White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --LightGray: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    --GrayishBlue: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
    --DarkBlue: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
}
```



### Continued development

Mobile first, responsiveness.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com) - I chose W3Schools grid system layout to help me tackle centering grid items.
